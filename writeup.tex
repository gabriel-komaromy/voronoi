% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly

% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's

% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:

\section{Introduction}
Robotic motion planning is the problem of finding a path from the starting
configuration of a robot to some goal configuration that does not collide
with any obstacles. In the case where the positions of the obstacles are
known \emph{a priori} but the start and goal configurations are not, it
can be useful to create a \emph{roadmap} of the configuration space.
Roadmaps demonstrate connected edges through the free space such that a
robot can easily move to some edge from a starting configuration, and
easily move to the goal configuration from some edge. If there is a path
between the two edges in free space, the roadmap should have a path between
them.

\subsection{Voronoi Diagrams}
\emph{Voronoi diagrams} are a class of roadmap. The basic definition
of a Voronoi diagram is that its edges represent the points that are
equidistant from the closest obstacles to that point. This means that each
edge represents the path that maintains the maximal separation from two
obstacles while traveling between them. Following the Voronoi edge between two
obstacles minimizes the chance of a collision with an obstacle, which is
a desirable property when the transition dynamics for the environment are
non-deterministic and the cost of a collision is high. Visually, a Voronoi diagram divides
the free space into \emph{Voronoi regions} of points that share a common closest obstacle.\\
\indent Voronoi diagrams are theoretically defined in spaces of arbitrary dimension
and for obstacles of any shape. However, the complexity of creating the
diagram grows quickly with the dimensionality of the configuration space.
Additionally, more complex obstacle shapes bring more complex edges on the diagram.
In this paper, we focus on two-dimensional environments with obstacles that
are points.

\subsection{Nearest-Neighbors Classification}
Voronoi diagrams have other uses beyond robot motion planning.
One application, which we explore in this paper, is to use a Voronoi diagram
to build a \emph{k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) classifier}. KNN classifiers come from
the field of machine learning. The classification problem is as follows:
given a \emph{training set} of feature vectors with labels of either 0 or 1,
produce a machine that, given a new feature vector \emph{T}, will identify the \emph{k}
members of the training set with the closest feature vectors to \emph{T}. The
output label for \emph{T} will be the class that the majority of the \emph{k} nearest
neighbors belong to. The metric used to define the ``closest'' feature
vectors can vary based on the characterization of the available features,
but the simplest way to measure it is to take the distance between the
two points plotted in Euclidean space.\\
\indent A complete Voronoi diagram can be used trivially as a KNN classifier with
$k=1$; finding the Voronoi region that a test sample belongs to is sufficient,
as the nearest neighbor is the training sample associated with that region. For
higher values of $k$, the classification problem is non-trivial. We explore how
to implement such a system in this paper.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Creating Voronoi Diagrams}
The problem of an efficient algorithm for creating Voronoi diagrams has been
thoroughly explored in the literature. One of the most prominent is the Sweepline
algorithm introduced by Fortune~\cite{fortune1987sweepline}. Conceptually,
the Sweepline algorithm moves a line (the eponymous Sweepline) through the plane
containing the obstacles. In this paper, we will use the convention that the
sweepline begins as a horizontal line at the obstacle with the highest y-value
and moves downwards through the rest of the obstacles.
\subsubsection{Incremental Construction}
As we sweep down the plane, some obstacles will be above the sweepline and others
will be below. The half-plane above the sweepline is then further separated
into a region of points whose nearest obstacle we can be sure of, and a region
whose points may be closer to an obstacle below the sweepline than to any obstacle
above the sweepline. The finalized and unknown regions are separated by a
\emph{beach line}.\\
\indent The beach line consists of a set of parabolic arcs joined together at
the intersections of the arcs. An example beach line is shown in Figure~\ref{beachline}.
Each arc of the beach line has a corresponding obstacle that is the closest point to
it. Geometrically, the arcs take the form of parabolas because each obstacle is the
focus and the sweepline is the directrix of a parabola. The points on the parabola
are equidistant from the focus and the directrix.

\begin{figure}[tp]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{beachline}
    \caption{Example of a beach line. The parabolic arcs are the beach line. The line
    segments above the beach line are finalized. The dashed line segments are the
    edges of the true Voronoi diagram that are not yet finalized. Taken
    from~\cite{compgeometry}.}\label{beachline}
\end{figure}

\indent The intersections of the beach line arcs are points that will be on Voronoi
edges, equidistant from the obstacles corresponding to the two arcs meeting at
that intersection. As the sweepline moves down, the arcs and the intersection do
as well. A Voronoi edge is created by connecting the point where the intersection
first occurred to the point where it disappears.\\
\indent Computationally, it is impossible to move the sweepline down the plane in
a continuous manner. We have to choose discrete points where the updates to the
beach line will occur. Fortunately, there are a limited number of points that can
change the structure of the beach line. We refer to these points as \emph{obstacle
events} and \emph{circle events}.

\subsubsection{Obstacle Events}\label{obstacle_events}
Obstacle events occur when the sweepline encounters a new obstacle. That obstacle then
must be inserted into the beachline. We locate the arc that the new obstacle is
directly under and split it into two parts, one on either side of the new obstacle.
At the moment when the obstacle is first encountered, it resides exactly on the
beach line. This means that its ``arc'' in the beach line is actually given by a
vertical line segment up to the existing arc that it splits. As the sweepline moves
further down the plane, the arc widens and takes the usual parabolic curve.\\
\indent In the special case where a new obstacle appears directly below an existing
intersection in the beach line, we place the new arc between the two existing arcs
and do not split either of them.\\
\indent In general, two concave-up parabolas given by $y=Ax^{2}+Bx+C$ can have a varying number of points
of intersection. If the two have equal first derivatives and some vertical offset,
there are no points of intersection. If the two have equal first derivatives and
some horizontal offset, there is one point of intersection. If the first derivatives
are unequal, there are two points of intersection. If the first derivatives are
equal and there is no offset, there are infinite points of intersection as the
parabolas are identical.\\
\indent Fortunately, we only need to consider the cases with one and two points
of intersection. The case with only a vertical offset is impossible during the
sweepline algorithm, as a vertical offset means that the first derivatives will
be different. The case with infinite points of intersection can be averted
by eliminating repeated obstacles before diagram construction. The problem
that remains is finding the one or two intersection points.\\
\indent If the y-values are equal and there is only one intersection, the x-value of that
intersection is the midpoint between the x-values of the minima of the parabolas.
The equation for the x-value of intersections of parabolas with different
y-values and foci $a$ and $b$ is given in~\cite{schaal} as
\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{a_{y}b_{x}-\sqrt{a_{y}b_{y}({(a_{y}-b_{y})}^{2}+b_{x}^{2})}}{a_{y}-b_{y}}
\end{equation}
However, this only gives one intersection, when we know that there should be two.
Working backwards through the derivation presented in~\cite{schaal}, we find that the
equation for both intersections is given by
\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{a_{y}b_{x}\pm\sqrt{a_{y}b_{y}({(a_{y}-b_{y})}^{2}+b_{x}^{2})}}{a_{y}-b_{y}}
\end{equation}
Usefully, in the case where the focus with the lower y-value is on the sweepline,
the two intersections given by this equation are equal. Additionally, given the
x-values for the intersections, finding the y-values is simply a matter of plugging
into the equations for either of the parabolas.
Note that these equations are only valid after a translation where the y-value of the
sweepline is subtracted from $a_{y}$ and $b_{y}$, and $\min(a_{x}, b_{x})$ is
subtracted from $a_{x}$ and $b_{x}$. The opposite translation has to be applied to the
output intersections~\cite{schaal}.

\subsubsection{Circle Events}
Circle events are when an arc is consumed by its neighbors and removed from the
beach line. They are called circle events because the intersection of the Voronoi
edges occurs at the center of the circle formed by the three points on the beach
line, as shown in Figure~\ref{circle_event}. Furthermore, the event itself is the
point on the circle with the lowest y-value; when the sweepline passes this point,
there can be no other obstacles closer to the intersection.\\

\begin{figure}[tp]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{circle_event}
    \caption{Arcs converging to an intersection. The middle arc will soon be
    removed from the beach line. Taken from~\cite{mitslides}.}\label{circle_event}
\end{figure}

\indent However, if an obstacle is encountered within the circle before the
circle event, the circle event is no longer relevant and is removed from consideration.\\
\indent Not all sets of three consecutive obstacles have a circle event below them.
The most common case for this is that with three such obstacles $a$, $b$, and $c$,
ordered by increasing x-value, $b$ lies below the line segment connecting $a$ and
$c$. This would mean that the circle event is above $b$, and therefore above the
current position of the sweepline. Checking for this case amounts to computing the
signed area of the triangle formed by $a$, $b$, and $c$, given in~\cite{schaal} as
\begin{equation}
    A_{signed}=\frac{1}{2}
    \begin{vmatrix}
    a_{x} & a_{y} & 1\\
    b_{x} & b_{y} & 1\\
    c_{x} & c_{y} & 1\\
    \end{vmatrix}
\end{equation}
If $A_{signed}<0$, then the center of the circle is below $b$.
Another case where the circle event does not need to be considered is that if
$a$, $b$, and $c$ are collinear, there is no circle containing all three of them.

\subsection{Data Structures}
There are two fundamental data structures used in the construction of the Voronoi
diagram.

\subsubsection{Beach Line}
The first data structure represents the beach line. Optimally,
this would be implemented as a balanced binary search tree such as an AVL tree or
red-black tree. In this tree, leaf nodes represent obstacles and
the internal nodes represent the intersections between arcs~\cite{mitslides}.\\
\indent In the interest of ease of implemenation, we instead use a doubly-linked list to
store the beach line. Nodes in the list contain obstacles, and two adjacent nodes have
pointers to each other and to the growing Voronoi edge between them. Using a list
instead of a search tree increases the complexity of locating the arc that a
new obstacle falls under from $O(\log n)$ to $O(n)$.\\
\indent In this setup, a node has two adjacent edges, each with an intersection
at its endpoint. When a node is first encountered by the sweepline, its arc is a
vertical line, and so only intersects the beach line once. However, the equation
for intersections in Section~\ref{obstacle_events} returns two copies of this
intersection. This allows us to create the arcs without having to handle an
additional case.\\
\indent An obstacle can have multiple nodes associated with it. Each time the
obstacle's parabola is split by an obstacle event, the single node containing
that segment of the arc splits into two. This corresponds to the obstacle's
Voronoi region gaining an incident edge.\\
\indent When a circle event occurs, the corresponding obstacle's node is removed
from the list and its neighbors are joined together, forming an intersection on the
Voronoi diagram and a new edge leading out of it.

\subsubsection{Event Queue}
The second data structure is a priority queue containing the events, which we refer to as
the \emph{event queue}. We implement this using a binary heap, Python's \emph{heapq}.
Initially, the event queue contains all of the obstacles minus duplicate obstacles,
beginning with the obstacle with maximal y-value. Ordering ties are broken by
placing the event with the lower x-value first.

\subsubsection{Interactions}
There is some overlap between the responsibilities of the beach line and the event
queue. Both of them keep track of circle events: each node in the beach line
has an associated circle event, if any, and the event queue contains the
active circle events in addition to the obstacle events. After each event,
the nearby nodes in the beach line are examined for circle event updates. This
includes both adding potential new circle events if a node was added to the
beach line, and removing circle events if a new obstacle falls inside the
circle. If a circle event is removed from the beach line, it also is removed
from the event queue. This is a costly operation because lookup in a heap
costs $O(n)$.

Figure~\ref{voronoi} shows the results of creating a Voronoi diagram with fifty
point obstacles with $x$ and $y$ coordinates randomly selected from a uniform
distribution between $0$ and $10$. While we did not analytically verify the
results, the output looks intuitively correct.

\begin{figure}[tp]

    \caption{Voronoi diagram for randomly-generated points}\label{voronoi}
\end{figure}


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.




% conference papers do not normally have an appendix





% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
%\IEEEtriggeratref{8}
% The "triggered" command can be changed if desired:
%\IEEEtriggercmd{\enlargethispage{-5in}}

% references section

% can use a bibliography generated by BibTeX as a .bbl file
% BibTeX documentation can be easily obtained at:
